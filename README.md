## Current Project

### [üçî Rumble Remake](https://github.com/ec-rilo/rumble) | [Notion Board](https://www.notion.so/Rumble-Remake-6f0092ce9e61448f94b794dc8bf524f5)
<b>Utilized:</b> Next.js | JS | Firebase Auth | Tailwind CSS | MongoDB + Mongoose

A food decision making app, done tinder-style, a project I revisited to remake on my own. While the client was happy with Rumble I made previously I knew I could push the project further. So I'm working on revisiting the entire architecture from scrach and implementing a cleaner user interface with a new database.
